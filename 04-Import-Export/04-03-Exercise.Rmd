### Exercise

* Create a new project
* Create an R script. Call it `Histogram.R`.
* Write a function that takes a dataframe and a continuous `column` name and plots a customized histogram. Customize `color`, `fill` and theme. And finally plot it with plotly.
    * Hint: within ggplot pass the column name with `get(column)` to avoid any confusion.
* Create a Now, you can "source" this file from a new R notebook:

```{r message=FALSE}
source("Histogram.R")
```

And reuse that function over and over again:
```{r message=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
Histogram(mpg, "cty")
```

```{r message=FALSE}
Histogram(diamonds, "price")
```

### Practice
* From your GitHub create an empty repository
* Clone this repository from RStudio
* repeate the previous steps
* Commit your changes
* Push them to your repository
